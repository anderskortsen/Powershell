I've decided to create a small PowerShell advent calendar. I've used a lot of PowerShell scripts throughout the years, but often when the script wasn't working I did not know what to do.
Therefore I decided to deep back into the basics of PowerShell. I need to understand what objects, pipelines, cmdlets etc. are. Maybe you need to get the basics beneath your skin as well. 
Follow along!

Powershell is available across platforms. It comes built into Windows 8 or later, whereas on Mac OS and Linux, you need to install it youself. I'll be working on my Windows 10 Machine and therefore I 
won't guide you through the installation process. If you need it, look no futher than here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.2 

I will be using an IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) and I recommend you use it as well.
